                <h4>When You Get Forced to Dance</h4>
                <h5>SMH.</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Do you hate it when schools just tell you to choreograph your own dance steps despite having absolutely no originality and experience? Yeah, me too. It’s frustrating to be forced into something that you’re not comfortable with, especially when you already have a lot on your plate.</p>

                <p>I mean, I get that they want to encourage creativity and self-expression, but come on. Not everyone is cut out for dancing, let alone choreographing their own routine. Plus, we all have busy schedules with academic and extracurricular commitments. How are we supposed to fit this in?</p>
                    
                <p>It’s not just about coming up with a good routine, but also executing it well and making sure you don’t mess up. The stress and anxiety of it all can be overwhelming.</p>
                    
                <p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that we shouldn’t challenge ourselves and try new things. But there’s a difference between willingly taking on a challenge and being forced into something that you’re not comfortable with. It’s important for schools to remember that not everyone has the same interests or talents, and that’s okay.</p>
                    
                <p>Honestly, I’m not looking forward to this at all. The thought of having to choreograph and perform my own routine is actually infuriating. I don’t think this experience will be rewarding for me at all. But I’ll try my best and hope that it turns out okay. Atleast.</p>
